# arduino-esp8266-http-server
A tiny http server running on arduino with esp8266 using AT-commands over SoftwareSerial.
The functionality is very basic - run a callback on specific http path hit and return something to the browser.
The code needs to be improved, especially error handling.

The code was written for and tested on Cactus Micro [http://wiki.aprbrother.com/wiki/Cactus_Micro_Tutorial] which is basically 
a LilyPad Arduino USB with ESP8266.
